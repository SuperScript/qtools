= How To Install qtools

qtools comes with NO WARRANTY.

== System requirements
The qtools package works only under UNIX systems that run qmail.
Additionally, email repliers configured with +replier-config+ require
+ezmlm-weed+ from the http://cr.yp.to/ezmlm.html[ezmlm] package.

== Installation

Download the qtools package.  The most recent qtools package is
link:{package}-{version}.tar.gz[{version}].

Unpack the qtools package:
!!!!
gunzip {package}-{version}.tar
tar -xf {package}-{version}.tar
cd {package}
!!!!

Compile the qtools programs:
!!!!
make
!!!!

Run some tests.  Normally, this produces no output:
!!!!
make test
!!!!
If the tests fail, manually compare their output with the expected results:
!!!!
./rts > rts.out
diff rts.out rts.exp
!!!!

As root, install the qtools programs under +/usr/local+:
!!!!
make setup check
!!!!

Report successful installation:
!!!!
( echo 'First M. Last'; cat `cat SYSDEPS` ) \
| mail web-inst@superscript.com
!!!!
replacing +First M. Last+ with your name.
