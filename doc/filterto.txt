= filterto (1)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
filterto - conditionally forward a filtered message

== SYNOPSIS 
In +.qmail+:
!!!!
| filterto !address! !prog!
!!!!

where +!address!+ is an email address, and +!prog!+ is one or
more arguments specifying a program to run for each message.

== DESCRIPTION 
The +filterto+ program runs +!prog!+ with a message on standard input.  If
+!prog!+ exits{nbsp}0, +filterto+ forwards the standard output from +!prog!+
to +!address!+, and then exits{nbsp}99.  If +!prog!+ exits{nbsp}111,
+filterto+ exits{nbsp}111. If +!prog!+ exits with any other exit
code, or does not exist, +filterto+ exits{nbsp}0. 

*NB*: It is not safe for +!prog!+ to fork a child that reads the message in
the background.

*NB*: If you use +filterto+ in a +.qmail+ file, make sure to add a line
specifying delivery to your normal mailbox.
