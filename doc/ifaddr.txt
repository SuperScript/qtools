== NAME
ifaddr - match addresses in headers

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
ifaddr [ !field! ... : ] [ !addr! ... ]
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION 
The +ifaddr+ program reads a message from standard input.  It exits{nbsp}0 if
any +!addr!+ appears in a +!field!+ header, and exiting{nbsp}100 if there is
no match.  Invoked with no +!addr!+ arguments, +ifaddr+ looks for the address
in the environment variable +$RECIPIENT+.  Address comparisons are case
insensitive.  If no +!field!+ arguments appear, then +ifaddr+ uses +To+ and
+Cc+.

If an +!addr!+ begins with +@+, then +ifaddr+ compares it to the domain
portion of addresses from each field.


== EXIT STATUS 
If it encounters a temporary error while reading input, +ifaddr+
exits{nbsp}111.


== EXAMPLES 
The +.qmail+ line
!!!!
| condtomaildir !dir! ifaddr to cc from : !myfriend!
!!!!
writes correspondence with +!myfriend!+ to +!dir!+.

The +.qmail+ line
!!!!
| condtomaildir !dir! ifaddr @example.com
!!!!
writes a message with a +To+ or +Cc+ address in the domain +example.com+ to
+!dir!+.
