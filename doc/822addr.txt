== NAME
822addr - extract email addresses from messages

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
822addr !field! ...
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +822addr+ program reads an 822-format email message from standard input.
For each input header +!field!+, +822addr+ parses the value of the header as
one or more email addresses and prints the result to standard output.  If no
+!field!+ appears, +822addr+ looks for +!to!+ and +!cc!+.

Output records are null terminated.  The first character of each output record
indicates the address type, and the remainder is the value.  A delivery
address begins with a +++ character, and a comment begins with a +(+
character.  When paired, a comment precedes an address.

The end of the message or the first line that cannot be part of an 822-format
header field terminates the search.

== EXIT STATUS 

If it encounters an error while processing a message, +822addr+
exits{nbsp}111.  If +822addr+ finds any matching headers, it exits{nbsp}0.
Otherwise, +822addr+ exits{nbsp}100.

== BUGS
No formatting options.
