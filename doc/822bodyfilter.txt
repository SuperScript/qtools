== NAME
822bodyfilter - filter a message body

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
822bodyfilter !prog!
!!!!

== DESCRIPTION 
The +822bodyfilter+ program reads an 822-format email message from standard
input.  It executes +!prog!+ with the body of the message on standard input,
and prints the message headers followed by the output from +!prog!+ to
standard output.

The end of the message or the first line that cannot be part of an 822-format
header field terminates the message headers.  A nonblank line that terminates
the headers is part of the message body.


== EXIT STATUS 
If +822bodyfilter+ encounters a temporary error in executing +!prog!+, it
exits{nbsp}111.  If +822bodyfilter+ encounters a permanent error in executing
+!prog!+, it exits{nbsp}100.  Normally, +822bodyfilter+ yields the same exit
code as +!prog!+.  The standard input to +822bodyfilter+ must be seekable.
