== NAME
checkaddr - check input for matching address

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
checkaddr !addr! ...
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION 
The +checkaddr+ program reads email addresses from standard input, and
compares them with each +!addr!+ without regard to case.  If no +!addr!+
appears, +822addr+ uses the environment variable +$RECIPIENT+ as +!addr!+.
The +checkaddr+ program reads addresses in the form output by
link:822addr.html[+822addr+].  It considers only delivery addresses and
ignores address comments.


== EXIT STATUS 
If it finds a match, +checkaddr+ exits{nbsp}0.  Otherwise, +checkaddr+
exits{nbsp}100.
