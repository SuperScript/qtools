== NAME
replier-config - configure an instance of replier


== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
replier-config !dir! !dot! !local! !host! [ !outlocal! [ !outhost! ]]
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION 
The +replier-config+ program configures an instance of
link:replier.html[+replier+], the qtools auto-responder.  It creates +!dir!+
and populates it with configuration files.  It creates two qmail files called
+!dot!-help+ and +!dot!-return-default+.  The +!local!+, +!host!+ arguments
together determine the local delivery address configured for auto-response.
The +!outlocal!+, +!outhost!+ arguments are used in the responses.

The directory +!dir!+ must begin with a slash.  If +!outlocal!+ is not
present, +replier-config+ sets it to +!local!+.  If +!outhost!+ is not
present, +replier-config+ sets it to +!host!+.

If +!outlocal!+ is not empty, +replier-config+ creates a new email replier at
the address
!!!!
!outlocal!-help@!outhost!
!!!!

If +!outlocal!+ is empty, +replier-config+ creates a new email
replier at the address
!!!!
help@!outhost!
!!!!

In either case, +replier-config+ sets up two +.qmail+ files to control the
help-address replier: +!dot!-help+ and +!dot!-return-default+.  These files
should control messages to the addresses +!outlocal!-help@!outhost!+ and
+!outlocal!-return-@!outhost!+, respectively (or +help@!outhost!+ and
+return-@!outhost!+ if +!outlocal!+ is empty).

Within +!dir!+, +replier-config+ creates several configuration files for
+replier+.

The first line of +!dir!/inlocal+ consists of +!local!+.

The first line of +!dir!/inhost+ consists of +!host!+.

The first line of +!dir!/outlocal+ consists of +!outlocal!+.

The first line of +!dir!/outhost+ consists of +!outhost!+.

The first line of +!dir!/mailinglist+ consists of 
+contact !helpaddress!; run by replier+, where
+!helpaddress!+ is the help address created by
+replier-config+ as described above.

The +!dir!/headerremove+ file contains
!!!!
return-path
return-receipt-to
content-length
!!!!

The +!dir!/headeradd+ file contains
!!!!
Precedence: bulk
!!!!

The +!dir!/text/help+ file contains text sent in response to messages received
at the help address.

== EXAMPLES 
To configure a replier at the address +joe-replier-help@example.com+, the
user +joe+ issues the command
!!!!
replier-config $HOME/replier $HOME/.qmail-replier joe-replier example.com
!!!!

If email to +joe@example.com+ is delivered to
+joe@joehost.example.com+, the following command may be
appropriate to configure a replier at
+joe-replier-help@example.com+:
!!!!
replier-config $HOME/replier $HOME/.qmail-replier joe-replier joehost.example.com joe-replier example.com
!!!!

If the user +replier+ handles mail for the virtual domain
+replier.example.com+, then the following command creates a
replier at +help@replier.example.com+:
!!!!
replier-config $HOME/replier $HOME/.qmail replier example.com ""
!!!!

=== Adding replier addresses
To add a new replier address that filters only the body of a message,
edit the +!dir!/bodyfilter+ shell script and add a new case
corresponding to the new address.  Then create a symbolic link from
+!dir!/qmail-bodyfilter+ to the +.qmail+ file that
controls the new address.  That's it!

Adding a command to filter the message header is entirely analagous,
but use +!dir!/headerfilter+ and
+!dir!/qmail-headerfilter+, while entire-message filters use
+!dir!/msgfilter+ and +!dir!/qmail-msgfilter+.


=== Bounce handling
By default, a replier created with +replier-config+ silently
throws away bounce messages.  The +.qmail+ file controlling
bounces is a symbolic link pointing to +!dir!/bouncer+.  Edit
+!dir!/bouncer+ to change the treatment of bounce messages.


== BUGS 
The very existence of this program is a bug.
