== NAME
checkdomain - check input for matching address domains

== SYNOPSIS 
!!!!
checkdomain !dom! ...
!!!!


== DESCRIPTION 
The +checkdomain+ program reads email addresses from standard input, and
compares the domain portion with each +!dom!+ without regard to case.  If no
+!addr!+ appears, +checkdomain+ uses the domain part of the environment
variable +$RECIPIENT+ as +!dom!+.
The +checkdomain+ program reads addresses in the form output by 
link:822addr.html[+822addr+].  It considers only delivery addresses and
ignores address comments.


== EXIT STATUS 
If it finds a match, +checkdomain+ exits{nbsp}0.  Otherwise, +checkdomain+
exits{nbsp}100.
